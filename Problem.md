Design a class named Stock that contains:
■ A string data field named symbol for the stock’s symbol.
■ A string data field named name for the stock’s name.
■ A double data field named previousClosingPrice that stores the stock
price for the previous day.
■ A double data field named currentPrice that stores the stock price for the
current time.
■ A constructor that creates a stock with the specified symbol and name.
■ A method named getChangePercent() that returns the percentage changed
from previousClosingPrice to currentPrice.
Draw the diagram for the class and then implement the class. Write a test
